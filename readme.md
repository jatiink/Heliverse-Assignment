# Machine Learning Model Performance Analysis

This project aims to analyze the performance of various machine learning models on a dataset. The dataset contains information about employee attrition, and the task is to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features.

## Model Analysis
The performance of several machine learning models is evaluated on this dataset. The following metrics are considered for each model:
- Train Accuracy
- Test Accuracy
- ROC AUC score
- Time taken for training and prediction

## Models Evaluated
The following machine learning models are evaluated in this analysis:
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- GridSearchCV (Tuned hyperparameters for Random Forest)
- Bagging Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
